# Abbreviation Extractor

This project is an Abbreviation Extractor application built using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to upload a Word document (.doc or .docx) and extracts the abbreviations and their definitions using Artificial Intelligence.

## How It Works

- Users upload a Word document using the file input on the main page.
- The document is sent to a backend API endpoint where it is processed.
- The API leverages Artificial Intelligence to extract abbreviations and their definitions from the document.
- The extracted data is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering and routing
- **React**: Building the user interface
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling the application
- **Material-UI**: Additional UI components
- **Framer Motion**: Animations and smooth transitions
- **Artificial Intelligence** : Generation of Abbreviation meanings within context
